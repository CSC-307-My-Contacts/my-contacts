## Description

The My Contacts web application provides users with a secure and intuitive interface to manage their contacts. Users can create an account with a username and password and then login to safely view their contacts. Information such as a contactâ€™s name, email addresses, phone numbers, and picture can be recorded for future use. In addition, users can search their contacts and organize them by groups. For compatibility with existing contact services My Contacts supports importing a contact CSV, which can be exported from Google Contacts or Outlook Contacts.
