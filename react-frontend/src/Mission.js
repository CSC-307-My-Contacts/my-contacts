      <h3>Mission</h3>
    The world we live in is fraught with pain, fear, anger, disappointment, strife, failure, agony, misery, anguish, despair, grief, woe, torment, and misfortune. Yet humanity pushes on, a funeral march in the rain, more concerned with the droplets of cold November precipitation than the mortal destination of our destinies. One bootful of mud after the other we approach our craven rest, in constant denial of its cold certainty we are forced to focus luridly on the plagues of the living. There is no warmth in the fading evening, there is no brightness in the drowning lights. The band plays a morbid tune, ears and eyes full of sadness while their notes mark the passing of each somber moment. For what reason we stride on, we can not say. But, if there’s one thing we here at My Contacts can say, it’s that the sadistic, Sisyphusian droning forced onto us by our own cruel existence is better when you never lose a contact. Through our innovative use of databases, JavaScript, and Python (technologies at the fore-front of modern Computer Science research) we have revolutionized the way people connect with the world around them. By developing using work-mind conscious techniques we’ve streamlined our communicative data flows to optimize man-hours per line of code, enabling us to deliver an application that can only be described as revolutionary. Gone are the sleepless nights, memorizing flashcards of phone numbers. Gone are the weekends lost to the endless chase of the perfect rolodex. Gone are the public shamings for misremembering a family member’s email address. And, here, is the rest of your life. Welcome to My Contacts. Stay Connected.
